        <h1>Uwezo Community Initiative Ambassador Talking Points and “Asks”</h1>
    <h2>Elevator Speech</h2>
<p>Uwezo Community Initiative creates opportunities for training and employment, equipping individuals living with intellectual disabilities with on-the-job skills to build experience and open the door to future opportunities.
We work with community partners and other local restaurants to bring the program to individuals interested in learning skills and seeking long term employment. We welcome partners interested in providing training opportunities and open to increasing their diversity and inclusivity and welcoming individuals living with disabilities on to their teams.
The program has supported individuals in Howard County for over five years, helping participants maintain independent living and contribute meaningful to our local economy.

<h2>Talking Points – Program Overview</h2>
<p>
Howard County offers several resources and programs for the disability community. There are also programs that connect individuals to employment. However, there is not a program to provide on-the-job training skills. Uwezo Community Initiative has developed a successful model to provide industry standard, hands-on training, and give individuals living with disabilities the skills they need to sustain long term employment
<br/>
• Through the current Uwezo program:
<br/>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Uwezo staff are alerted by Anegada Delights (Uwezo’s founding restaurant partner) that there is a space on staff<br/>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Uwezo reaches out to community partners (see below) to see if anyone would like to participate in the program<br/>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o If someone is identified, the participant goes through a 16-week ServSafe-based curriculum<br/>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o If training is successful, the individual joins the Anegada Delights staff<br/>
• Uwezo has successfully helped 12 individuals living with disabilities complete on the job training and secure employment. Two of our most successful participants have remained on staff at
Anegada Delights for the past 5 years. Our program has enabled them to maintain independent living and contribute meaningfully to our team and the local economy<br/>
• We currently have partnerships with Arc, Project Search (HCPSS) and Way Station to identify individuals who could benefit from the program; however, our capacity is limited to openings that currently exist in our restaurant<br/>
• Our vision is to expand this program so all individuals living with disabilities have the opportunity for training and employment. In order to reach this goal, we will need to:<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Formalize a referral process with community partners serving individuals living with disabilities<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Identify other restaurants willing to offer on-the-job training<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Open the program more broadly to the public<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Secure funding to support expansion and sustainability<br/>
• While Uwezo’s focus is on providing job skills and training, we also remain connected to restaurants across the County who have employment openings. As our network of restaurant partners grows, we will be able to connect individuals who complete the training with long-term employment, as positions become available.
</p>
<h2> Funder “Asks”</h2>
<p> Uwezo seeks funding to expand the proof-of-concept of its model (already shown successful) by:<br/>
o Phase 1: Piloting the program with 1-2 new referral sources, and 1-2 new restaurant partners; October pilot with the Arc of Howard County is confirmed<br/>
o Phase 2: Expanding the program, and pursuing sustainability by opening referrals to the public (with a nominal fee to cover materials). As the program expands, additional funding will also be needed for:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ▪Equipment, uniforms, and stipend for trainees<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ▪Curriculum<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ▪Transportation (e.g., getting from classroom training to restaurants)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ▪Staff/admin time<br/>
</p>
<h2> Partner “Asks”</h2>
<p> In order to expand and sustain the program, Uwezo will need to identify partners to refer individuals to the program.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  o We currently have partnerships with the Arc of Howard County, Project Search (HCPSS), and Way Station<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  o We are offering an October training cycle, in partnership with the Arc of Howard County<br/>
.We will also need to identify additional restaurant partners willing to provide on-the-job training – and subsequently offer long-term employment (as openings arise)<br/>
• Restaurants are encouraged to consider participating because employing individuals with disabilities:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Changes people’s lives. “I’m doing this because of what I’ve seen my staff go through, and how grateful they are to have long-term employment. I hear from Sam [one of our employees] all day about how he feels supported” (Elizabeth Ndungu, Executive Director)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Increases workforce diversity – research shows that diverse teams produce better work. Organizations committed to diversity also create cultures that support the characteristics of high performing organizations<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Increases revenue by creating better, more universal products – example of curb cuts; increasing accessibility for individuals using wheelchairs also increases access for parents with strollers. Leads to a broader customer base<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Battles against misconceptions that individuals with disabilities incur hire costs – research shows that more than half of accommodations needed by disabled employees cost nothing; and accommodations that do come with a cost are usually limited to between $300 and $500<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Helps restaurants create a brand story as an inclusive, representative business<br/>
• Restaurants employing individuals living with disabilities are also eligible for a number of tax credits, including the Maryland Disability Employment Tax Credit, and the Work Opportunity Tax Credit.<br/>
